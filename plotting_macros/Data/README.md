This directory contains plotting code for data. It also contains a number of scripts to simplify the interaction with the plotting code.

# v0cutvarsingle
Runs `plotCutVariation.C`
Specify input, data set, hadron, variable to investigate, pt, fit settings and rebinning.

# v0cutvar
Same as v0cutvarsingle, but runs all variables

# plotCutVariation.C
Plots purity and efficiency of V0 sample when cutting on one or more of their variables.
Combine plots manually for an overview.

# plotJet.C
# plotPurity.C
# plotV0.C
# plotV0MassinJet.C
# plotV0inJet.C

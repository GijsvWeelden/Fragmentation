# this shell script downloads the results from a hyperloop train run to stbc.
# The script expects a train number, and tries to get the test dir using this number.
# Once the train numbers exceed 6 digits this procedure will fail, but hopefully I'll have finished my PhD by then
# Run it as follows from inside an O2 environment:
#   `bash copyTrainResults.sh 123456`
# or in one go like:
#   `alienv setenv O2Physics/latest -c bash copyTrainResults.sh 123456`
# Sometimes, this script will fail to download the output, saying the specified source could not be found.
# Running the script again resolves this.
